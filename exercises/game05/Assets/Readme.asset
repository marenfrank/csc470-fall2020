    text: '|-I want to make a game where you are a little doggie, and you move around
      to collect bones in a dog park. When you select another dog you become that
      dog. You can also shoot laser beams at cops (the enemy). The more bones you
      collect the higher your health bar. If the police hit you then you lose health.
      You can also set out dog treats for the dog to go to and collect. Last you
      can click a button to roll a ball for the dog.   It will include all the game05
      requirements: Mouse interaction with GameObjects via OnMouseXXX functions Raycasting
      from the mouse position to recognize what was ''under the mouse'' Positioning
      UI elements based on world positions Orthographic projection with the camera
      Rotating a game object towards a point over time  Making a Meter on the UI
      that represents a unit''s health A "waypoint" system where the player can place
      markers and then tell the unit to follow them in order.  '
