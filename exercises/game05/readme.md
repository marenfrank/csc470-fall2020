# Doggie Game
I want to make a game where you are a little doggie, and you move around to collect bones in a dog park. When you select another dog you become that dog. You can also shoot laser beams at cops (the enemy). The more bones you collect the higher your health bar. If the police hit you then you lose health. You can also set out dog treats for the dog to go to and collect. Last you can click a button to roll a ball for the dog.  

It will include all the game05 requirements:
Mouse interaction with GameObjects via OnMouseXXX functions
Raycasting from the mouse position to recognize what was 'under the mouse'
Positioning UI elements based on world positions
Orthographic projection with the camera
Rotating a game object towards a point over time 
Making a Meter on the UI that represents a unit's health
A "waypoint" system where the player can place markers and then tell the unit to follow them in order.
