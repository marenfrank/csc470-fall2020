# Doggie Game
The game is called Hounds. First you choose a little doggie and name it. Next you move around to collect cookies in a dog park.You can also shoot laser beams at cops (the enemy). The more cookies you collect the higher your treat count. You need a 10 cookie count to win the game. If the police hit you then you lose health, and if your health goes to zero you lose th game. You can also set out balls for the dog to go to and collect. 
# Technical Enhancements  
* I will need to take text from a text input feild for the dog name 
* Create a Health Bar with a slider that can take damage and add health 
* A button that creates a ball that rolls that a dog will go collect
